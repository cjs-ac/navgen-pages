# [navgen-pages](https://cjs-ac.github.io/navgen-pages/)
A GitHub Pages form of the navgen NAVEX generator.

**navgen** allows users to input ten-digit grid references, and will compute:

* grid bearings;
* magnetic bearings;
* distances; and
* paces

for the path between those points. Users must provide the magnetic deviation and number of paces per hundred metres (sensible defaults are provided). Bearings can be calculated in degrees (default) or mils.
